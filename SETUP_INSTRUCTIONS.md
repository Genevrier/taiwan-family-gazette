# Taiwan Family Gazette - Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

I've fixed the following issues in your project:

1. **Supabase Configuration**: Updated to handle missing environment variables gracefully
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Fixed version compatibility issues (downgraded from v4 to v3)
3. **PostCSS Configuration**: Updated for Tailwind CSS v3
4. **Auth Context**: Added proper error handling for missing Supabase credentials
5. **Custom Colors**: Added primary color definitions to Tailwind config

## üîß Next Steps - Environment Setup

Once you have your Supabase credentials, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Environment File
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# Database (Supabase provides this)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres

# NextAuth (optional)
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
```

### 2. Database Setup
Run the following commands to set up your database:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push the schema to your database
npx prisma db push
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
